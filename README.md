# Event Satisfaction Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Objective
Analyze participant satisfaction levels from an event or seminar survey.

Identify the key factors influencing participant satisfaction and engagement during the event.

Present interactive visualizations using Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.

## Description
The dataset contains survey responses collected from university event participants.

Each response includes metrics such as overall satisfaction, topic quality, speaker performance, comfort level, and discussion activity.

Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and exploration, and Power BI for visualization and insight generation.

## Descriptive Analysis
The majority of respondents were from Universitas Pakuan.

The average satisfaction and comfort scores ranged between 4.53 (very satisfied).

The highest-rated speaker was Sigit Purmono Said (Pasha Ungu).

All event aspects, including topic relevance, speaker delivery, and interaction, received highly positive feedback.

## Insights
Nearly 60% of participants focused on one speaker, Pasha Ungu. 

The “Topics Presented” score (4.47) indicates room for improvement in 
relevance

Only 387 of the 409 participants who attended responded to the survey. 

## Recomendations
Conduct a pre-event survey to map participants' needs and expectations.

Involve speakers with more diverse backgrounds to attract a wider audience.

Segment the audience based on institutional background (students, high school students, 
professionals).
